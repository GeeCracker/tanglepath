# tanglepath
QHacks 2020 Project

tanglepath is a webapp that allows the user to submit different locations where they've lived, and it returns to them a vector graphic of what their path in life looks like. Built on HMTL and CSS with a JS backend. We used the Google Maps Geocoding API to get coordinates for locations based on user inputs.
